# \*🎯success indicator (KPI)

The event listening module should include real-time event listening and historical event retrieval (which should record the block number, and when the service is first started, restarted, or the listener is disconnected, it should continue reading from the previously recorded block). Meanwhile, it is also necessary to consider different chains, meaning that multiple contract addresses, RPCs, chainIds, etc., need to be maintained for each chain.
