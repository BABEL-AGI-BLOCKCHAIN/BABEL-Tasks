# \*⛳️Why do this?

The training dataset for AGI should expand monotonically over time, so it is necessary to design a logic for expansion.

# \*case 1

How to ensure that the data covers a variety of situations and scenarios, prevent overfitting, and enhance the model's generalization ability

# \*case 2

What types of training data can be supported (images, videos, text, etc.)

# \*case 3

How to prevent data falsification and garbage data?

# \*case 4

# \*case 5

# case N

# case N (1)
