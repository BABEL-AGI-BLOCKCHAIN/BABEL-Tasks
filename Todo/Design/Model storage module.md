# \*Description

Challenging module, the AGI model data consists of four parts (model code, model parameters, training data, and validation data), with each part independently iterating and upgrading. Except for the model code, the other components involve massive amounts of data. Therefore, sharded storage is required.

# \*‚õ≥Ô∏èWhy do this?

The foundation of AGI large model training
