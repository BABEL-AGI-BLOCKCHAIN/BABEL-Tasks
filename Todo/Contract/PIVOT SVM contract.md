# \*Description

Implement the SVM-compatible PIVOT contract.

# \*‚õ≥Ô∏èWhy do this?

PIVOT plays a key role in the BABEL ecosystem, driving the development of a decentralized AGI data marketplace. By implementing topic-based versions of the PIVOT contract, it lays the foundation for the valuation of AGI models. To expand the interoperability of PIVOT, implementing a Solana version of the contract will enable integration with the Solana blockchain ecosystem, increasing the reach and flexibility of the protocol for users and developers.
