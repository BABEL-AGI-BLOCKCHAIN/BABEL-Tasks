# \*Description

Implement the EVM-compatible BABEL token contract by inheriting the ERC20 contract.

# \*‚õ≥Ô∏èWhy do this?

The purpose of developing the BABEL-token placeholder is to provide a transition mechanism before the launch of the BABEL chain, allowing users to acquire temporary BABEL tokens on an existing blockchain. This way, users can obtain tokens in advance and, once the BABEL chain is operational, convert the temporary tokens to native BABEL tokens through swap. This ensures the continuity of the token supply and a smooth value transfer. Additionally, the BABEL-token placeholder will be used for bounty rewards in tasks.
