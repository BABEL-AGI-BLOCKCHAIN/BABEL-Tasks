# \*Description

Update the README to include the project introduction, framework details, installation instructions, environment variables and other configurations, testing and deployment commands, and deployed contract addresses. The contract addresses should be separated for mainnet and testnet and display in a table.

# \*‚õ≥Ô∏èWhy do this?

To provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the PIVOT SVM contract, making it easy for developers to understand the project, set up the environment, test the contract, and deploy the contract to both mainnet and testnet. This will ensure smooth integration and usage.
