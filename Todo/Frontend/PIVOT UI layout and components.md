1. On the homepage, display various topics. Each topic will show:
    - Title, content, author (Twitter or wallet address), image
    - Total investment amount, single investment amount, current investment position
    - Number of comments, publication time, ERC20 token name (and its logo)
2. Clicking on each sub-market will open a view with all user comments.
3. Users should be able to comment on topics or invest in them.
4. Implement a fixed header that remains visible during page navigation, containing:
    - Wallet connection button
    - Button for posting topics
5. "Post Topic" button should redirect to a page where the poster can input:
    - Topic title, content, image, single investment amount, ERC20 token address
    - A final "Post" button to publish the topic.
