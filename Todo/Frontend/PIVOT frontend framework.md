4. Wrap the methods for calling.

# \*‚õ≥Ô∏èWhy do this?

Modular structure is a key foundation of frontend code, significantly improving code maintainability and scalability. RainbowKit is used to support different wallets. Web3 SDK is used for connecting wallets, switching networks, calling contracts, etc.
