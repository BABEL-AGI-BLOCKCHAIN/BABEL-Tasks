# BABEL Tasks

## Overview

BABEL tasks are now publicly managed via GitHub. To participate in task completion, contributors must follow the workflow outlined below.

## Claiming a Task

-   Tasks are listed in the `Todo` directory.
-   To claim a task, fill in all fields marked with an asterisk (\*).
-   Create a new branch from the main branch locally, move the task files from the `Todo` directory to the `Reviewing` directory, push the changes to GitHub, and create a pull request (PR) to merge into the main branch.
-   Each task can only be claimed by one person at a time.
-   If a task is rejected during review, it will be moved back to the `Todo` folder for others to claim.

## Task Progression

Each task follows these stages:

1. **Todo**: Available tasks.
2. **Reviewing**: Tasks submitted for reviewing.
3. **InProgress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
4. **Done**: Completed tasks.

## Submission Process

-   The assignee must submit a commit with the implemented task.
-   The task must be moved between directories (`Todo` → `Reviewing` → `InProgress` → `Done`) based on its actual progress. Unless rejected (`Todo` → `Reviewing` → `Todo`).
-   Tasks should be moved using **cut**, not **copy**.
-   Any modification or movement of tasks must be done through a PR (Pull Request).
-   Each commit must be mentioned in the community for tracking and reviewing.
